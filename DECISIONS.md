# Decisions List

## D-001: Logo and icon set for the web app

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-25
- Decision: The logo was traced from the uploaded raster into a vector SVG with CSS variables for all colors. A full icon set was generated from it: SVGs, favicon.ico, 180/192/512/1024 px PNGs in transparent, dark (#000000) and light (#ffffff) versions where relevant.
- Why: One vector source keeps every size consistent and lets the colors be edited in one place. The Apple-sized canvas (logo about 70% of the height) leaves room for iOS corner masking. A separate tight crop (about 92%) keeps the favicon readable at small sizes.
- Alternatives considered: A hand-drawn SVG would be cleaner but less faithful to the original. Inline SVG components via SVGR would allow runtime recoloring but need a new dependency. Both were not chosen for now.
- Consequences: Files live in public/. The CSS variables only work when the SVG is inlined, not through <img> or as a favicon. A maskable PWA icon and an og:image are not covered yet. The App Store icons are only needed for a native iOS build. Schema changes never go through the MCP; they follow D-014.

## D-002: Theme toggle buttons in both navigation bars

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-25
- Decision: Each navigation bar gets its own round button that switches between the dark and light theme through the existing useTheme() hook. The icon shows the theme you will switch to (sun in dark mode, moon in light mode).
- Why: The theme state, the data-theme attribute and the theme tokens already existed, so the simplest fix was a button that calls setTheme. Separate components per bar let each match its own visual style (glowing two-layer icons in the NavBar, plain filled icons in the FloatingNavBar).
- Alternatives considered: One shared button component (less duplication, but the two bars look different). A toggleTheme function in the context (needs two more files). Saving the choice in localStorage (left for later; needs an early script to avoid a flash). Putting the FloatingNavBar button between the text field and "Go for it" (needs changes to Input.jsx).
- Consequences: The FloatingNavBar now follows the app theme instead of the OS setting. The choice is lost on reload. The NavBar mobile bar and the FloatingNavBar on narrow phones are wider or tighter and need a visual check. Each toggle contains the same one-line "pick the other theme" logic.

## D-003: V2 card browser data and integration boundary

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-26
- Decision: Implement the first card-browser flow under `/v2` and leave V1's
  card browsing behavior intact. Keep filters in the URL and apply them to the
  TanStack Query-cached result set; do not issue a Scryfall request for each
  filter change. Use existing dependencies, convert only the touched browser
  and navigation surfaces to TypeScript, and keep the new styling local to
  those features.
- Why: V2 is the target shell and its navbar already offers the search entry
  point. Reusing the query cache and the existing layout-aware card renderer
  avoids duplicate data requests and renderer logic while limiting risk to the
  working V1 app.
- Alternatives considered: Replacing V1, integrating the feature into both
  versions, filtering only a new server query per filter, adding a card-state
  library, and reorganizing all app CSS. These were not selected because V1
  must remain available, local filtering satisfies the requested cache-first
  behavior, existing packages already cover routing/query/table needs, and a
  broad migration is unnecessary.
- Consequences: Implemented. `/` opens the V2 home page, which displays seven
  cards from the daily mulligan set. V2 search filters only the first
  175-card Scryfall result page. The search-source toggle is URL-backed.
  The daily mulligan uses an explicit non-digital set-type allowlist because
  the Scryfall Set object has no booster-eligibility field; one
  `unique=cards`, random-ordered search request supplies the seven displayed
  cards.
- The details overlay uses one flip control beneath the artwork to switch the
  artwork and rendered face, gives the details column less width than the
  printings column, and shows flip/favorites/collection/decks actions on
  printing tiles. Favorites, collection and deck actions remain
  under-construction notices until those features have storage. Collection-mode
  search also remains an under-construction notice.
- The desktop navbar search border follows its content width. On mobile, the
  search icon expands and focuses the input; navigation links hide while it is
  focused. Enter or a second tap on the search icon submits, and Escape closes
  the field.

## D-004: Supabase project and security baseline

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Use one Supabase project in an EU region for local development and the Netlify site. Only the publishable key reaches the browser (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`). The auth redirect allow-list holds `http://localhost:5173/**` and the Netlify URL. Unused auth providers are off, and the Data API exposes only the `public` schema.
- Why: This is a solo learning app, so one project keeps setup small. A publishable key in a bundle is only safe because RLS restricts every row.
- Alternatives considered: Separate dev and production projects (safer, double the setup, can be added later). Any use of the secret/service-role key in the app (rejected: it bypasses RLS).
- Consequences: Dev and production share data. Free projects can pause after inactivity (verify current rules). Keys never go in chat or the repo, and Netlify holds the production values. New projects expose no tables to the Data API by default, so every migration must grant access explicitly. Legacy anon/service_role keys are not used. The production redirect entry is tightened to the callback route in D-008. Status: implemented once the checks above pass.

## D-005: Supabase MCP is read-only

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Connect the Supabase MCP server to VS Code Copilot, scoped to this project with `read_only=true`. Schema changes are tracked and applied through the migration workflow in D-014.
- Why: Database content can carry prompt-injection text, so a write-enabled agent is a risk. Read-only still lets Copilot inspect schema, logs and advisors.
- Alternatives considered: Write-enabled MCP (faster, riskier). No MCP (loses the inspection help).
- Consequences: The workspace MCP entry is in the gitignored `.vscode/mcp.json`; first-time OAuth authentication in VS Code is still required. Copilot cannot apply migrations. To enable writes later, remove the flag, keep the project scope and per-call approvals, then record a superseding decision.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-006: Favorites table keyed to a card printing, with owner-only RLS

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Create `public.favorites (user_id, scryfall_id, created_at)` with primary key `(user_id, scryfall_id)`, an index on `(user_id, created_at desc)`, RLS enabled, and select/insert/delete policies for `authenticated` users on their own rows. `anon` has no access. `scryfall_id` is the Scryfall card id, which identifies one printing. There is no `profiles` table.
- Why: The composite key prevents duplicates and indexes lookups by user. The second index serves "latest added first". `user_id` defaults to `auth.uid()`, so the browser never sends it.
- Alternatives considered: Favoriting the card across printings via `oracle_id` (dedupes, but loses the printing). A `profiles` table now (nothing to store yet). Snapshotting card JSON (goes stale).
- Consequences: Two printings of one card are two favorites. A nullable `oracle_id` column can be added later without breaking anything. The migration is applied and verified in the project: the table, key, index, RLS policies and grants match this decision, and an anonymous Data API read is denied. The pgTAP owner-isolation suite is authored but still needs to run against a local Supabase database. Use the migration workflow in D-014, never the SQL editor.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-007: Supabase client and AuthProvider

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Add `@supabase/supabase-js`, create a single client in `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`, and add an `AuthProvider` with a `useAuth` hook. The provider sits inside `PersistenceProvider` and around `RouterProvider`. On sign-out it removes the favorites queries.
- Why: The library already stores the session and refreshes tokens. A context plus a hook matches the existing `ThemeProvider` pattern.
- Alternatives considered: Reading the session separately in each component (duplicated logic). A state library (new dependency, unnecessary). Auth UI packages (less to learn, less control).
- Consequences: The existing `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency and `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` configuration are used by the shared client. `AuthProvider` exposes session, user, loading state and sign-out through `useAuth`; sign-out removes favorites queries from the React Query cache. Implemented; sign-in UI and user-facing auth routes are covered by D-008.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-008: Email and password authentication

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Add `/v2/login` with email/password sign-in and signup, plus `/v2/auth/callback` for email confirmation. After authentication, navigate to `next` only when it starts with `/v2/` and contains no `//` or backslash; otherwise use `/v2/home`.
- Why: Use Supabase's built-in password authentication rather than passwordless OTP, while keeping a dedicated route for account access.
- Alternatives considered: Passwordless email OTP (D-008's previous implementation); literal usernames (not supported as a native Supabase Auth identifier).
- Consequences: Supabase email confirmation must be enabled/configured as desired, and the callback URL must be in the Auth redirect allow-list. Email confirmation links are for signup verification only; normal sign-in uses the password. Password reset and profile management are outside this decision. Implemented.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-009: RequireAuth layout route

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Wrap `/v2/favorites`, `/v2/binder` and `/v2/decks` in a `RequireAuth` layout route. It renders nothing while the session loads, an inline sign-in invitation linking to `/v2/login?next=<current path>` when signed out, and `<Outlet />` when signed in.
- Why: An invitation fits your request better than a silent redirect, and the loading state avoids a flash.
- Alternatives considered: Redirecting to the login route (loses the page context). Guarding inside each page (duplicated).
- Consequences: This guard is UX only. Security is enforced by RLS, never by the client. Implemented.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-010: Paginated card source for the card browser

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Define a `CardSource` shape (`cards`, `isLoading`, `isFetchingNextPage`, `hasNextPage`, `fetchNextPage`, `error`). Implement it for Scryfall search with `useInfiniteQuery`, following `next_page` while `has_more` is true. Add a "Load more" button. Keep the current daily-set mode as a single page and leave V1 untouched.
- Why: One source shape lets search, favorites, collections and decks share the card browser. A button is the simplest trigger and keeps Scryfall requests polite.
- Alternatives considered: Infinite scroll with an intersection observer (a new dependency, can come later). A separate browser per page (duplicates the filter code).
- Consequences: Search results can be paged beyond the first 175 cards, but local filters and sorts cover only cards loaded so far. The daily set remains limited to seven cards and V1 is unchanged. The paginated hook reads Scryfall's `has_more` and `next_page` metadata directly, and uses a query-key prefix that `PersistenceProvider` does not persist. Implemented.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-011: Favorite hooks and the heart toggle

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Add `useFavoriteIds` (a query for the user's `scryfall_id` set) and `useToggleFavorite` (a mutation that inserts or deletes, then invalidates). Optimistic updates come later. The heart on `CardTile` replaces the under-construction notice. For anonymous users it shows the sign-in invitation.
- Why: One id set lets every tile show its heart without a request per card.
- Alternatives considered: Checking each visible card with `.in(...)` (more requests). Starting optimistic (more concepts at once).
- Consequences: The favorite-ID query pages through results in bounded batches to avoid API row caps. Favorites are never persisted to `localStorage`; they are loaded for the current authenticated user and refreshed after successful toggles. Anonymous users receive a sign-in invitation that returns to the current page. Implemented.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-012: Favorites page on the shared card source

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Implement `CardSource` for favorites. Each page reads up to 75 rows ordered by `created_at desc, scryfall_id desc`, continuing from the last row with a composite cursor. It resolves them through Scryfall's `POST /cards/collection`, re-orders them by the Supabase order, and skips ids Scryfall no longer returns. Page size is a single constant.
- Why: Scryfall accepts at most 75 identifiers per request. Cursor paging stays correct when favorites are added or removed between pages.
- Alternatives considered: Offset paging (rows can shift). Relying on Scryfall's response order (not guaranteed).
- Consequences: The favorites hook issues one Scryfall collection request for each loaded page and skips missing cards without changing Supabase pagination. The composite cursor avoids skipping favorites with tied timestamps. "No sort selected" means latest added. Collections and decks can implement the same `CardSource` later. Implemented.

## D-013: Email delivery for magic links

- Status: Not working
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Use Supabase's built-in sender during solo development, and choose a free SMTP provider before inviting others.
- Why: The built-in sender is for testing and heavily rate-limited, but enough for one developer.
- Alternatives considered: Brevo (free daily quota, can verify a single sender address), Resend (free monthly quota, needs a domain you control), Mailtrap (test inbox only, no real delivery). Verify current free limits.
- Consequences: Passwordless magic-link sign-in was not reliable and is no longer the sign-in flow. The replacement is recorded in D-017. Supabase may still send email confirmation for signup, depending on Auth settings.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-014: Schema tracked as migration files and applied with the Supabase CLI

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Keep every schema change as a timestamped SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`, created with `supabase migration new` and applied with `supabase db push` (dry run first). The CLI is pinned as a dev dependency and invoked through `npx`. Local Docker is optional for testing; the dashboard is for reading and experiments, not for schema changes.
- Why: Files in git give a reviewable history and one source of truth. `db push` also records each migration in the project's migration history, so later automation knows what is already applied. Pasting into the SQL editor would leave that history empty.
- Alternatives considered: SQL editor plus committed files (simple, but files and database drift, and later automation would try to re-run them). Hand-written GitHub Actions running `db push` (needs the access token and database password stored as GitHub secrets). A local Docker stack (best for testing, heavy for now).
- Consequences: The Supabase CLI is pinned as a dev dependency, and `supabase/MIGRATIONS.md` documents setup, local pgTAP testing, dry-run, apply, and history verification. `supabase login` and `supabase link` are one-time local setup; local database testing requires Docker, but remote migration application does not. Rollbacks are new forward migrations. Each migration still needs approval per AGENTS.md. If the schema is changed in the dashboard, `supabase db pull` captures it as a file. Implemented; no remote schema changes were made as part of this workflow setup.
- Source: "[Supabase] Migrations and GitHub"

## D-015: Supabase GitHub integration deploys migrations from main

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: After `favorites` is merged, connect the Supabase GitHub integration to this repository only, with the working directory at the repo root, "Deploy to production" on for `main`, and automatic branching off.
- Why: Merging to `main` then applies pending migrations, and no database password or access token is stored in GitHub. Deploying from GitHub works on any plan.
- Alternatives considered: Keep manual `db push` (enough for one developer, nothing to configure). Branching with per-PR preview databases (isolated and data-less, plan requirements to verify, not needed without users). GitHub Actions with stored secrets.
- Consequences: Supabase gets read access to the repo. With one shared project, a merge changes the live database. Because D-014 records history, migrations already applied from the feature branch should not run twice; verify on the first merge. `config.toml` does not push auth settings, which stay in the dashboard (D-004). Revisit if a staging project is added.
- Source: "[Supabase] Migrations and GitHub"

## D-016: Generated TypeScript types for the database

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Generate `src/types/database.ts` from the linked Supabase project's `public` schema with `supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema public` and pass `Database` to `createClient<Database>()` in D-007.
- Why: `npm run typecheck` then catches wrong table or column names at compile time.
- Alternatives considered: Hand-written row types (drift from the schema). No types (no checks).
- Consequences: `src/types/database.ts` is generated and committed, and must be regenerated after schema migrations. The pinned CLI workflow is documented in `supabase/MIGRATIONS.md`. TypeScript catches Supabase table and column mismatches in typed files; JS/JSX files stay unchecked, as in AGENTS.md. Implemented.
- Source: "[Supabase] Migrations and GitHub"

## D-017: Email and password authentication replaces magic-link sign-in

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Use Supabase's native email/password signup and sign-in on `/v2/login`; keep `/v2/auth/callback` for signup email confirmation and return users only to validated `/v2/` paths.
- Why: Passwordless magic-link sign-in was not working reliably during testing. The password flow supports regular sign-in without requiring a magic link each time.
- Alternatives considered: Continue troubleshooting passwordless magic links (D-013, not working); literal username/password authentication (requires a custom username identity mapping because Supabase's native password identifier is email or phone).
- Consequences: Signup confirmation emails may still be sent when email confirmation is enabled in Supabase Auth. SMTP delivery configuration is not required for normal password sign-in. Existing D-008 routes implement this flow; remote Auth settings are managed separately.
- Source: "[Supabase] Auth and favorites plan"

## D-018: Cross-device favorites refresh and printing availability

- Status: Pending
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Keep favorites synchronized across signed-in devices using Supabase Realtime notifications to refresh the authenticated user's favorites. In the card browser, also surface the user's favorited printing when it is absent from the current Scryfall name-search results. Deduplicate by Scryfall printing ID and apply the existing local filters and sorting to the combined results. Leave the daily seven-card set and unrelated searches unchanged.
- Why: The current favorite-ID query only refreshes after local mutations or when it becomes stale; it does not notify another open device. Search results are also returned independently by Scryfall and may not include the exact printing saved as a favorite.
- Alternatives considered: Rely on periodic or focus-triggered refetching (not immediate on an already-open device). Refresh only the favorite heart state (does not make the missing printing available in the browser).
- Consequences: The implementation plan is to add a reusable user-owned-table Realtime invalidation hook that future collection and deck queries can also use; extract shared, bounded Scryfall collection hydration for card IDs; use both for favorites; and merge matching missing favorite printings into name-search results. Realtime notifications are refresh signals only; re-fetch data under existing RLS rules rather than trusting event payloads as authorization. Enable the favorites table in the `supabase_realtime` publication through a migration. Preserve search pagination, deduplication by printing ID, and local filter/sort behavior. No code or remote database changes have been made; implementation is pending.
- Source: "[Supabase Realtime: Postgres Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes)"; "[Supabase Realtime: Subscribing to Database Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes)"

## D-019: Select between Scryfall and personal collection search

- Status: Pending
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Decision: Add a search-scope toggle with two modes: "Scryfall" searches the public Scryfall catalog, and "Personal collection" searches only the signed-in user's owned card sources. Initially, the personal scope includes Favorites; when the collection feature is implemented, include Collection there as well. Keep Scryfall as the default scope.
- Why: Searching a user's own cards is a different task from searching the full Scryfall catalog, and should not require them to remember which page contains each card.
- Alternatives considered: Keep independent search experiences on separate pages (less discoverable). Search Scryfall and personal sources together by default (mixes owned and unowned results).
- Consequences: The selected scope must be visible and preserved while searching. Personal-scope results must respect the current user's access controls and should combine supported personal sources without duplicates by Scryfall printing ID. Until Collection exists, the personal scope searches Favorites only; collection records must not be implied or fabricated. Implementation is pending.
- Source: User request, 2026-10-27

## D-020: Binder and decks roadmap

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Ship the binder completely (D-021 to D-032) before starting decks (D-033 to D-037). Each step below is its own decision, planned with a short plan before code and closed with its own check. A binder entry is one copy per row; "loose" is `binder_id = NULL`.
- Why: Multiple copies with per-copy metadata do not fit favorites' `(user_id, scryfall_id)` key. Finishing the binder first gives decks a stable, documented base.
- Alternatives considered: Interleaving binder and deck steps (deck rules would need tables that do not exist yet); a quantity column per card (cannot hold per-copy metadata); a real "Loose" binder row (special-case rename and delete rules).
- Consequences: Order is fixed: A (D-021 to D-024, no database), B (D-025 to D-032, binder), C (D-033 to D-037, decks). Every migration needs explicit approval and a dry run, because one Supabase project serves development and production (D-014, D-015).
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-021: Logout SVG icon

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Create `LogoutIcon.tsx` in `src/assets/navigation/` using the nav icon pattern (24-unit viewBox, `nav-icon` class, `nc-trace`/`nc-core` layers, `1em` size), and use it in `NavBarDesktop.tsx` and `NavBarMobile.tsx` in place of the `↪` text glyph.
- Why: The glyph does not follow the theme or hover/active behavior of the other icons.
- Alternatives considered: Keep the glyph and style it with CSS (still not a real icon, inconsistent shapes); an icon library (new dependency, not needed).
- Consequences: Touches three files, so a short plan is shown first. Existing `aria-label="Log out"` and the `isSigningOut` state stay unchanged. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; both navbars show the new icon with the same hover behavior as the others.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-022: Card action order and flip icon style

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: In `CardTile.tsx`, order the actions favorite, binder, deck, then flip last. Redraw `IconTurnAround.tsx` in the nav icon style (24-unit viewBox, `1em`, two-layer trace/core).
- Why: The flip button is rendered first today, and its 48-unit viewBox, stroke 4 and fixed 32px size do not match the nav icons.
- Alternatives considered: Restyle the other icons to match the flip (would change the nav set); reorder only (leaves the visual mismatch).
- Consequences: Touches `CardTile.tsx`, `CardTile.css` and `IconTurnAround.tsx`. The hover-flip behavior on desktop and tap-flip on mobile must keep working. The `collection` action id becomes `binder` in D-023. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; icons are in the new order and visually consistent; flip still works by hover and tap.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-023: Replace Collection with Binder

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Rename the nav item label to "Binder", rename `CollectionIcon.tsx` to `BinderIcon.tsx`, change the route from `/v2/collection` to `/v2/binder`, and redirect the old path. Rename the `CardAction` value `collection` to `binder`.
- Why: The feature is a binder; "collection" implies a different, undefined thing.
- Alternatives considered: Keep the route and change only the label (path and label drift apart); no redirect (breaks existing links).
- Consequences: The Binder route stays behind `RequireAuth`, and the old `/v2/collection` URL redirects to it. The card-action value is `binder`; personal-collection search scope remains distinct. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; `/v2/binder` is protected and `/v2/collection` redirects to it.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-024: Card details: P/T, color pills, rarity pill

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: In the card-content panel, place mana cost beside power/toughness (and loyalty/defense when present), then color circles and a rarity pill on the next row, between type line and oracle text. This applies per face. Extend `CardBrowserCard` and `isCardBrowserCard` in `types.ts` for the fields needed.
- Why: The overlay currently shows none of these. Color circles give a quick visual cue, with accessible labels preserving their meaning; the rarity remains a text pill.
- Alternatives considered: Mana symbol images only (color-only, harder to read); showing P/T only below the rules text (requested next to mana cost).
- Consequences: Renderer metadata is opt-in for the details overlay, leaving other renderer surfaces unchanged. Color circles use the Magic colors and have accessible labels; stat and rarity pills share a height. Check: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and targeted lint pass; browser verification covers a single-face creature, a double-faced card, a colorless card, and a multicolor card.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-025: Binder groundwork: hydration, DB types, updated_at

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Extract the bounded Scryfall collection hydration from `useFavoriteCards` into a shared helper (D-018). Generate `src/types/database.ts` and pass `Database` to `createClient` (D-016). Add one shared SQL function `set_updated_at()` in a migration.
- Why: Binder pages need the same hydration as favorites. Typed tables catch column mistakes early. One trigger function serves every new table.
- Alternatives considered: Copy the hydration into binder code (duplication); skip generated types (untyped rows); the `moddatetime` extension (extra moving part).
- Consequences: The shared fetcher keeps the 75-card request bound, cancellation, validation, and error behavior; favorites ordering, missing-card handling, and keyset pagination are unchanged. `Database` types and `createClient<Database>` were already generated and are verified against the linked schema. The CLI-generated migration passed a linked dry run; it was not applied to the shared database. Check: typecheck, build, and targeted lint pass.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-026: Binder schema migration

- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: One migration creates `binders (id, user_id, name, created_at, updated_at)` and `binder_cards` (one row per copy: `id`, `user_id`, nullable `binder_id` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`, `scryfall_id`, `rarity`, `status`, `acquisition_type`, `acquisition_format`, `condition`, `finish`, `language`, `purchase_price`, `acquired_at`, `location`, `notes`, `disposed_at`, `disposal_price`, timestamps). Use `text` plus `check` constraints. Binder names are unique per user, case-insensitive. RLS on both tables, update granted only on editable columns, and policies verify that `binder_id` belongs to the user. Add RLS tests.
- Why: Per-copy rows hold per-copy metadata. `SET NULL` implements "deleting a binder moves cards to loose". `rarity` on each copy allows covers without Scryfall calls.
- Alternatives considered: Enums (harder to change); quantity column (no per-copy metadata); composite foreign key for ownership (more complex than a policy check).
- Consequences: `binder_cards.user_id` explicitly owns loose copies; cards attached to a binder must reference a binder owned by the same user. Grants exclude ownership and card-identity updates; timestamp triggers use the shared D-025 function. A paired manual rollback is in `supabase/rollback/`. The pgTAP tests cover grants, RLS isolation, ownership, and deleting a binder to move its cards to loose; they could not be run because the local database is unavailable (Docker is required). The linked dry run listed this migration as pending; it has not been applied by this task. Apply only after separately confirming the live database change.
- Source: "[Binder & Decks] Planning"

## D-027: Binder copies query and icon state

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Add `useBinderCopies`, one paged-loop query for all of the user's copies (as in `useFavoriteIds`), and derive `Map<scryfallId, copies[]>` with `useMemo`. `CardTile` shows the binder icon active with a copy count, and the favorite icon stays independent so both can be active.
- Why: One query serves icon state, hover content and binder views, with no per-card queries.
- Alternatives considered: A counts-only query plus lazy per-card loading (extra queries on hover); a database view (not needed yet).
- Consequences: Query key `["binderCopies", userId]`. Loading everything is fine at personal-collection sizes; if it grows, split later. Signed-out users get the sign-in invitation, as with favorites. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; icon and count match the database rows after reload.

## D-028: Add-copy overlay and mutations

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Clicking the binder icon opens an overlay to add a copy (defaults prefilled, all metadata optional, one-tap save). Clicking on an already-owned card adds another copy. Mutations return the written row (`.insert().select().single()`) and patch the cache with `setQueryData` instead of refetching.
- Why: Multiple copies are allowed, and avoiding a refetch after each change follows the "minimize queries" goal.
- Alternatives considered: Invalidate and refetch as favorites does (extra query per change); optimistic updates (more complexity, can come later).
- Consequences: The overlay form is a controlled form with typed fields mirroring the check constraints. Rarity is stored from the card at insert time. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; adding twice creates two rows; metadata survives reload.

## D-029: Copy popover: view, edit, dispose, delete

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Hovering the binder icon on desktop, or tapping it on mobile, opens a popover listing the card's copies with their metadata. It also opens on keyboard focus. Modify/save/cancel switch a copy into edit mode. Per copy: **Delete** removes the row after a confirm; **Mark sold/lost/given away** changes `status` and sets `disposed_at`, keeping the data. A History toggle shows disposed copies, and **Restore** returns one to owned.
- Why: Deleting loses data; disposing keeps history that feeds the future sales and balance goals.
- Alternatives considered: Hover-only metadata (not reachable on touch or keyboard); delete-only (loses history).
- Consequences: Default views show only owned copies. Deck-related warnings are not part of this step; they arrive in D-034. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; edit saves and cancels correctly; a sold copy disappears from the default view and reappears under History.

## D-030: Binder page: all-cards view and binder list

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: `/v2/binder` offers two views through NUQS (`?view=all|binders`, `?binder=<id>`). The all-cards view reuses `CardFilters` and the shared hydration. The binder list shows each binder with a cover chosen by rarity rank, then the Legendary supertype, then oldest added. A virtual "Loose" binder is always present and cannot be renamed or deleted. Users can create, rename and delete binders (with a confirm that states how many cards move to loose) and move copies, singly or in bulk.
- Why: Covers computed from loaded copies avoid fetching every card. Loose as `NULL` keeps rules simple.
- Alternatives considered: A stored cover id (needs manual upkeep); one table of all cards only (no binders).
- Consequences: Several files, so a short plan is shown first and likely split into sub-steps. A single hydration batch fetches covers for all binders. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; deleting a binder leaves its cards visible under Loose.

## D-031: Realtime refresh and personal search scope

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Implement the reusable Realtime invalidation hook from D-018 and apply it to favorites and binder tables, with a migration adding them to the `supabase_realtime` publication. Update D-019's personal scope to include binder copies, deduplicated by Scryfall printing ID.
- Why: Another open device should see binder changes, and personal search should cover what the user owns.
- Alternatives considered: Refetch on window focus only (not immediate).
- Consequences: Includes a migration, so approval and a dry run are needed. Realtime events are refresh signals only; data is refetched under RLS and event payloads are not trusted. D-018 and D-019 move from Pending to Implemented when done. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; a change on one device appears on another without reload.

## D-032: Binder release checkpoint

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Stop and verify before decks: run `typecheck` and `build`, test by hand on desktop and mobile, and update `AGENTS.md` (binder becomes a feature, decks remain a goal) and `DECISIONS.md` statuses.
- Why: Decks build on the binder, so it must be stable and documented first.
- Alternatives considered: Document everything at the end (context drifts and errors compound).
- Consequences: Lint is expected to keep its 19 pre-existing errors; only new errors count. No Phase C work starts until this passes. Check: both commands pass and `AGENTS.md` matches the source.

## D-033: Deck schema migration

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: One migration creates `decks (id, user_id, name, format, notes, timestamps)` and `deck_cards (id, user_id, deck_id ON DELETE CASCADE, kind binder|proxy|virtual, binder_card_id nullable, scryfall_id, timestamps)`. A partial unique index on `binder_card_id` allows one binder copy in one deck only. A check ties `kind = 'binder'` to a non-null `binder_card_id`. RLS policies verify ownership of `deck_id` and `binder_card_id`.
- Why: The database, not the UI, guarantees the one-deck rule.
- Alternatives considered: Separate tables per kind (more queries); a `quantity` column (cannot link copies).
- Consequences: Needs explicit approval and a dry run. Row per copy means a 60-card deck has 60 rows, which is acceptable. Check: RLS tests pass, and inserting the same copy into two decks fails.

## D-034: Delete or dispose a copy that is in a deck

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Add a Postgres function called through Supabase RPC that deletes or disposes a binder copy and, in the same transaction, converts its `deck_cards` row to `virtual`. The binder confirm dialog from D-029 then mentions the deck.
- Why: Two steps must succeed or fail together; the client cannot guarantee that.
- Alternatives considered: Two client calls (can leave a broken deck row); `ON DELETE CASCADE` (a card silently vanishes from the deck).
- Consequences: Needs migration approval. Reuses the ownership checks from D-033. Check: deleting a copy that is in a deck leaves a virtual card in that deck; a failure rolls back both.

## D-035: Deck flows

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Enable the deck icon: add a binder copy (picker shows only copies not in a deck), add a proxy or a virtual card, switch a card between binder/proxy/virtual, move a copy between decks as an explicit action, and assign an owned copy to a virtual card. Binder copies show an "In deck: X" badge. The overlay and popover reuse the D-028 and D-029 logic.
- Why: Decks should behave like the binder, as requested.
- Alternatives considered: A separate deck-only interface (duplicate logic).
- Consequences: Deck data loads with one query of ids and kinds, like binder copies. Removing a card from a deck offers back to binder, proxy or virtual. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; every transition leaves consistent data.

## D-036: Deck pages and proxy/virtual visuals

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Add a decks page mirroring the binder page (all view and deck list, covers by the same rule, NUQS state, `CardFilters` reuse). Proxies show a hashed border; virtual cards use a distinct muted style. Both must also be identifiable without relying on color alone.
- Why: Same logic and visuals keep the app consistent.
- Alternatives considered: Badges only (not what was requested).
- Consequences: Styles use `src/theme.css` tokens. Check: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass; the three card kinds are distinguishable in light and dark themes.

## D-037: Deck release checkpoint

- Status: Evaluating
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Decision: Verify and document: run `typecheck` and `build`, test by hand on desktop and mobile, and update `AGENTS.md` (decks become a feature) and `DECISIONS.md` statuses.
- Why: Same reason as D-032.
- Alternatives considered: Skip the checkpoint (documentation drifts from the source).
- Consequences: Closes the roadmap in D-020. Check: both commands pass and `AGENTS.md` matches the source.
