# Decisions List

## D-001: Logo and icon set for the web app

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-25
- Decision: The logo was traced from the uploaded raster into a vector SVG with CSS variables for all colors. A full icon set was generated from it: SVGs, favicon.ico, 180/192/512/1024 px PNGs in transparent, dark (#000000) and light (#ffffff) versions where relevant.
- Why: One vector source keeps every size consistent and lets the colors be edited in one place. The Apple-sized canvas (logo about 70% of the height) leaves room for iOS corner masking. A separate tight crop (about 92%) keeps the favicon readable at small sizes.
- Alternatives considered: A hand-drawn SVG would be cleaner but less faithful to the original. Inline SVG components via SVGR would allow runtime recoloring but need a new dependency. Both were not chosen for now.
- Consequences: Files live in public/. The CSS variables only work when the SVG is inlined, not through <img> or as a favicon. A maskable PWA icon and an og:image are not covered yet. The App Store icons are only needed for a native iOS build.

## D-002: Theme toggle buttons in both navigation bars

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-25
- Decision: Each navigation bar gets its own round button that switches between the dark and light theme through the existing useTheme() hook. The icon shows the theme you will switch to (sun in dark mode, moon in light mode).
- Why: The theme state, the data-theme attribute and the theme tokens already existed, so the simplest fix was a button that calls setTheme. Separate components per bar let each match its own visual style (glowing two-layer icons in the NavBar, plain filled icons in the FloatingNavBar).
- Alternatives considered: One shared button component (less duplication, but the two bars look different). A toggleTheme function in the context (needs two more files). Saving the choice in localStorage (left for later; needs an early script to avoid a flash). Putting the FloatingNavBar button between the text field and "Go for it" (needs changes to Input.jsx).
- Consequences: The FloatingNavBar now follows the app theme instead of the OS setting. The choice is lost on reload. The NavBar mobile bar and the FloatingNavBar on narrow phones are wider or tighter and need a visual check. Each toggle contains the same one-line "pick the other theme" logic.

## D-003: V2 card browser data and integration boundary

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-26
- Decision: Implement the first card-browser flow under `/v2` and leave V1's
  card browsing behavior intact. Keep filters in the URL and apply them to the
  TanStack Query-cached result set; do not issue a Scryfall request for each
  filter change. Use existing dependencies, convert only the touched browser
  and navigation surfaces to TypeScript, and keep the new styling local to
  those features.
- Why: V2 is the target shell and its navbar already offers the search entry
  point. Reusing the query cache and the existing layout-aware card renderer
  avoids duplicate data requests and renderer logic while limiting risk to the
  working V1 app.
- Alternatives considered: Replacing V1, integrating the feature into both
  versions, filtering only a new server query per filter, adding a card-state
  library, and reorganizing all app CSS. These were not selected because V1
  must remain available, local filtering satisfies the requested cache-first
  behavior, existing packages already cover routing/query/table needs, and a
  broad migration is unnecessary.
- Consequences: V2 filters only the first 175-card Scryfall search page.
  `/` opens the V2 home page, which shows the daily mulligan. The search-source
  toggle is URL-backed. The daily mulligan uses an explicit
  non-digital set-type allowlist because the
  Scryfall Set object has no booster-eligibility field; one `unique=cards`,
  random-ordered search request supplies seven cards from the returned page.
  Favorites, collection, and deck actions remain notices until those features
  have storage. Collection-mode search remains an under-construction notice.
