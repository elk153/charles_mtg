/**
 * Covers: flip. A single physical image with two text halves printed
 * upside-down relative to each other; "flipping" rotates 180deg rather
 * than swapping to a different image.
 *
 * Rotation now comes from the normalized face (face.rotation: 0 for the
 * first face, 180 for the second — see ROTATION_BY_LAYOUT), and CardFrame
 * applies it to the whole block. Previously this component computed
 * `isFlipped` locally and only rotated the <img>, leaving the text
 * unrotated — using face.rotation via CardFrame fixes that, since flip
 * cards print the *entire* second face (art + text) upside-down, not just
 * the art.
